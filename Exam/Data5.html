    <h3 >Exam Blog Post About Data-Driven Artwork</h3>

        Data-Driven Artwork. At first hearing this term may make one feel a bit confused because
        I was. The reason why I was confused when hearing about Data-Driven Artwork is because 
        I never really knew about the power of coding and how it can be used not only for logical, 
        mathematical projects but it can also be used to create artworks. 
        However, data-driven artwork isn't just coded artwork but "is an artistic practice that relies 
        on the usage of a dataset to convey emotions to the audience"  (Kirell Benzi - What is Data Art? A definition., no date). 
        Kirell Benzi goes onto say that the artworks reflect more of an "objective truth", rather than 
        an subjective interpretated truth because the artwork is based on data, actual facts.
    </p>

    <p>
        For part of this exam submission, we had to make our own data-driven artwork piece to our website. This artwork 
        had to interrogate the data in relation to the theory learnt during the second semester of the course. Thus, i created
        the artwork piece above where i have a simple looped circle and when you over over certain parts of it, it brings back 
        feedback of a certain colour. I used a new dataset, where I looked at the scoring CoinGecko did for the 
        top 3 NFTs currently. I choose to look at the top 3 NFTs' data because initially i wanted this new 
        dataset to be for my new data visualization but because of technical issues and glitches i had to make an executive decision
        and use the NFT dataset for my art piece. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        One thing I really struggled with during this process is that could i see beautiful examples of D3js website
        of different types of data visualizations that i could turn into an artpiece but i just couldn't figure out 
        how to implement the skeleton code into my code, i tried looking for videos on YouTube about how to implement the examples 
        of data visualizations on D3js but I could not find videos of the examples i wanted to use. There were no lecturers provided to 
        see how to implement the D3js examples, however I should have asked for a consultation in order to get the answer
        but there was no time left as the exam due data was pretty close when i ran into the problem. The initial D3js example
        I wanted to use was Zoomable Circle Packing. However, I instead resulted in using the D3 scale function of 
        sqrt in order to represent my NFT dataset
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I wanted this artwork to look like a visual piano. The smaller circle had the metaheroNFT NFT that was in 3rd place , and the 
        circle a bit bigger than it was the Wizards and Dragons NFT dnd lastly the biggest circle was the BoredApe NFT at the score of 11 by CoinGecko.
        The reason why i wanted to represent my data with circles is because circles are perfect, perfectly round and I wanted to show the accuracy of data through this. 
        To show perfect circles with accurate data but i wanted to hinder this perfection by adding an element that is imperfect. Thus, i added the onmouseover/enter event
        where the user will see designated colour when hovering over a specific circle. However, as a user you would expect to see interactivity over those specific circles but 
        instead of the colours filling within individual circles during hovering, the show on the enter frame of the artpiece. Thus, the circles and interactivity
        don't go together in harmony as they usually do but instead there are opposite of each other. The data visualization
        shows its perfection and accuracy and the interactivity shows its imperfection, a perfect balance to each other. This was inspired by the Yin and Yang sign, the theory of
        two complementary forces that make up a artpiece. We learnt about data-driven storytelling and I tried to tell the story of balance within imbalance with my data-driven artwork, 
        I wanted the user to feel like there are seeing the colours of the input on 'circle piano'
