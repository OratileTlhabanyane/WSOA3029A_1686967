    <h1> Historic Data Visualisation. Find and analyse an historic data visualisation. Tie your analysis in with Kidd’s, Friendly and Thompson. </h1>

            <br>
            <p>A historic visualization that I chose is categorized as ‘new graphic form’ which included a lot of different types of visual representation of data. The new graphic form was created during the year 1700 and 1799. The reason why this type of visualization took root is because people who made maps wanted to “show more than just geographical position on a map”(“Milestones in the History of Thematic Cartography, Statistical Graphics, and Data Visualization” n.d.). <br>
            <p>There is a long list of different types of graphic forms that were invented in 1700s such as a contour map, three-color printing, statistical significance, literal line graph, photography and many more. However, the one that will be analysing are the bar chart, line graphs of economic data by William Playfair, specifically the bar chart (“Milestones in the History of Thematic Cartography, Statistical Graphics, and Data Visualization” n.d.) . In the graph I am going to be analysing, Playfair used a three-parallel series namely prices of wheat, wages of good mechanics and the reigns of Kings and Queens of British. The three parallel series is one of the ‘unconventional’ aspects identified when analysing this graph, see figure 1.1. </p>

            <p>Bar graphs or line graphs use just two parallel series, one on the x-axis and the other one on the y-axis but this one shows how these graphs have evolved during time. This graph also has what looks like a line graph under the bar graph. Playfair has art skills and this is seen in his chart as he uses “creative combination of different visual forms” in this figure (Friendly 2008). Just taking a first glance at chart, the bars look like a silhouette of city building, I guess this is where we see his artistic skills even though those times, they didn’t have city buildings. <br>
            <p>
                To continue, this chart is aimed at looking at how the wages of mechanics affect the price. When we are looking at the bar graph, we see that, for example, the statistics show that during the 17th Century in the James 1 reign, the price of wages was at 10, and wheat was at 32 shillings. I struggled to read the bar graph portion of the chart, however the line graph was easier to understand. The reason why I say this is because as the prices of wages increase, the price of wheat in shillings increase as the years go forward. The blue coloured part of the line graph makes it easier for users to identify how the line is increasing through out the centuries.

        Playfair knew how to show data visually in a modern way even during the time in which he invented different forms of graph forms such as the pie chart. Playfair discovered that people consume images better than words (Thompson n.d.) and I think that how he was able to create innovative graphs during his time . <p>
