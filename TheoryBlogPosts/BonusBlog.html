    Bonus Blog 1</h2>
    <p><strong> This is a bonus blog post showcasing my creative side about how i feel the 
        internet has affected me and I am going to be doing this through a poem called DECOMPOSE</strong></p>
        <br>
    <p>
        Let the sky open and swallow my perishing sanity
        <br /> <br />
        Heaven gates open and accept my so-called serenity
        <br /> <br />
        Today marks the day my heartbeat got silenced
        <br /> <br />
        The day my toasted golden skin
        <br /> <br />
        Slowly deterioated from my unborn flesh
        <br /> <br />
        The day my marine blue artiries silently cracked opening
        <br /> <br />
        The day my artiries tasted the cold-iced air 
        <br /> <br />
        And started transitioning to a ruby red colour that none can compared
        <br /> <br />
        The day i decomposed 
        <br /> <br />
        Nothing can compare to the freedom felt by my blood 
        <br /> <br />
        As it busted through the imprisonment of my veins 
        <br /> <br />
        The impurities carried by my veins could not sin no more
        <br /> <br />
        My heart could not fake tranquility anymore
        <br /> <br />
        My snow-crystiled bones could not take it no more
        <br /> <br />
        The day i decomposed
        <br /> <br />
        I cannot blame you for my weakness
        <br /> <br />
        But you are the main reason for my sickness
        <br /> <br />
        Crucified and left me so defenseless
        <br /> <br />
        The day i decomposed
        <br /> <br />
        Thoughts were tired of thinking
        <br /> <br />
        Emotions were tired of feeling
        <br /> <br />
        Life was tired of living
        <br /> <br />
        Heaven was tired of waiting
        <br /> <br />
        So
        <br /> <br />
        I decomposed
