    <h1>Close reading and Reflection on Roeser, S. (2016) ‘HOW ART CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ETHICAL REFLECTION ON RISKY TECHNOLOGIES’</h1>

            Technology is forever developing. Each year comes with major and minor technological discovers/developments. There is a constant fear that technology may not be trusted, from the conspiracy theories about how robots may end up being mentally independent and go ‘rogue’, and end up getting rid of the human existence, to predications of technology increasing unemployment. All in all, debates about the risks of technology have a ‘right’ to be “heated and culminate in stalemates” (Roeser, 2016). Therefore, approaches such as visual art and literature are needed to conduct these debates in order to make “abstract problems more concrete”. 
        </p> 
            <br>
        <p>
            There are many artists, such as Leonardo Da Vinci, that took part and are still taking part in the development of technology and incorporating these technologies in their art. Film genres such as science fiction that look at the “utopian as well as dystopian visions of technological developments and their possible impacts on society” (Roeser, 2016). In the beginning of my reflection, I mentioned the conspiracies of robotics, according to Roeser artists such as Stelarc who engaged with ICT and robotics where he explored research as stem cell research which is not done in generic scientific way as being an artist, they look at this in “an imaginative, playful, and provocative way…”. This is one of the points that I can I fully agree with in Roeser’s reading about how technology can be extensively explored through the mind of an artists and Roeser uses Stelarc as a great example, especially how Stelarc wanted to use a human ear as part of Bluetooth’s system. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Moreover, Roeser speaks about techno-art and emotional-moral reflection about risk. Stelarc states how the aim for examples that I mentioned above, which are examples of techno-art, “provide for concrete, vivid images and narratives that make technological developments and their possible impact on society more tangible for a larger audience than is possible via highly specialised scientific articles and abstract philosophical theorising” (Roeser, 2016). Roeser’s argument throughout the reading could be about how we can create concrete evidence for impossible-looking developments of technology using art and if so, I agree with this argument. The reason why I agree is because I know how a creative mind can make the impossible, possible. Art is not just through painting and drawing but creativity takes place where emotions get evoked. A lot of people may confuse the idea that creativity can only take place in art and the ‘creative world’, but Roeser shows us how creativity has played quite a role in ‘managing’ the risks that come with the development of technology following the emotional-moral reactions. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Roeser continues to explore techno-art and public deliberation to challenges for techno-art. She states how techno-art may make an “important contribution to public debates, by highlighting societal implications, emotions and values related to new technologies. To conclude my reflection, to answer a question that Roeser asks during the reading is if artists should be bound by the same ethical and legal constraints as scientists when taking part in these debates. I agree that they should be following the dame constraints, the reason why I say so is because not only is an artistic mind wild, and broad and it needs ‘taming’ at times but everyone that is involved in the development of technology’s debates then they must all adhere to same “rules”. Thus, both participants will explore these technologies without harming the society in which technology impacts highly. Just like how technology is rapidly growing, techno-art and its contribution to it will also simultaneously grow.
