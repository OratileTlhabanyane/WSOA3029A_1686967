    <h1>Information is Beautiful  </h1> 
    <time datetime="2021/09/28">Posted Tuesday, 28 September 2021</time>

        <p>
            Representation and communication are essential in data visualization. The site Information is Beautiful show different ways in which different types of data is represented. I am going to choose one case study from the website and analysing its representation and communication.
           </p>
            <br>
        <p>Representation, according to Stuart Hall, is “the active work of selecting and presenting, of structuring and shaping…the more active labour of making things mean” (Hall & Open University 1997). There is a difference just simply representing data and the representation of data, representing data is showing data at face value. I chose the ‘Coronavirus Myths & Misconceptions’ case study on the website. The reason why I chose it is because of its clear communication seen its data visualization.  </p> 
              <br>
        <p>This page shows the different myths and misconceptions that took place during the Coronavirus world pandemic. A lot of rumours were going around which caused mass panic, so this website page shows all the ‘frequent’ myths. The data visualisation uses colour to assign categories for different myths or misconceptions for example, they use red for the category ‘prevention’, orange for ‘diagnosis’, etc. The page uses icons that relate to the myth and these icons are framed with their set category colours. </p>
              <br>
        <p>These icons are linked to actual facts about the set myth. I think this is one thing I actually appreciated about the page, they didn’t just represent the different myths and misconceptions around Coronavirus, but it shows representation of the specific data set. For example, with the red ‘prevention’ category, there is a myth that states that facemasks don’t help, and this myth has a label and a description of the myth. This myth then leads to a reliable article that gives proven statements about how facemasks reduce the chances of getting COVID-19. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>This communication and representation doesn’t only tell the user about the myth or misconceptions but it also puts meaning and further understanding to the myth by adding structure by linking reliable articles. The use of colour to designate them to each icon to its category was a simple but yet very effective communication.  </p>
