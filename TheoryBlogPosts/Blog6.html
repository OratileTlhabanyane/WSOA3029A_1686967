    <h1>Methods for analysis and critiques of UX and/or UI  </h1>

        <p>
           There are methods that can be use in order analysis user experience and use interface. 
            In my knowledge user experience (UX) is subjective so thus makes each person’s experience different and makes it hard to
            have a standard method to analysis a user’s subjective experience but user interface is easier to judge as it will be based 
            on conventions of wed designing. However, research show that there are methods that exist that help with analysing and criticizing 
            of user experience.
           </p>
            <br>
        <p>There is an article by Jeff Dance titled 8 Methods of UX Analysis that discusses eight methods of analysing user experience and 
            these eight methods fall under four categories which are the user perspective, the business perspective, and the expert experience
            but I am only to look at four of the eight methods (“8 Methods of UX Analysis” 2016). The first method is website and 
            device analytics which states that as the designer you need to know where your target market is lives in the digital space and 
            this method reveals the target market’s presences in regards to devices, browsers that they mainly use, etc. 
            You cannot develop a website to an audience that you do not know. For example, let’s say you want to create a good user 
            experience for kids between the ages of 2-5 years old, you would want to create an app where is mostly used on tablets and 
            phones instead of a website on a computer. </p> 
              <br>
        <p>The second method is the UX principles benchmarking where the business evaluates their site against the principles of UX which 
            helps improve their sites if needed be (“8 Methods of UX Analysis” 2016). One of the UX principle is “scrolling is faster than paging”, 
            for example now I can change my website and have my blogs on one page for users to scroll instead of having to go to each page 
            which takes up more loading time. Moving onto the last principle I am going to discuss on the blogpost, the third method for 
            analysing UX is UX trends evaluation which is basically finding out the current user-centred design and seeing if your 
            product/website needs the new innovative improvements, however, you need to make sure that these new trends match your end users’ 
            needs before implementing the trends to your product. For example, high resolutions are trending, according to the article, so you would not want to create high resolution pictures if your users are into old school pixel art. </p>
              <br>
        <p>In conclusion, there are 5 other methods that the article discusses but I decided to discuss the three which seem easy to digest. 
            There are many other methods on the internet that I did not dive into, however the ones that I did discuss give a very basic 
            standard of how to analyse a website’s user experience and these were very straightforward to understand which makes it easier 
            for designer such as myself to implement. I have learnt new things about user experience that even from a designer’s perspective 
            you can somehow critique how the end user’s subjective experience. </p>
