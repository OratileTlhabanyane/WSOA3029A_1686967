        <p>If we are being honest, web robots are slowly taking over our day-to-day lifestyle. We, as 
        humans, try to find ways to making living easier whether is shopping online instead of going 
        to physical shops or even asking Alexa to play our favourite song. This convenience was 
        thought of at some point in history someone thought of creating these internet robots for 
        human convenience. The history of the web robots. Where did it all start, why, how, and 
        when exactly? These questions will be explored in this blog post.</p> 
        <br>

        <p>The first ever use of started to emerge during the year 1988 of the use of Internet Relay 
        Chat. IRC is the original chatting program that existed before the times of WhatsApp and the 
        IRC robots provided group communication as well as one-on-one conversations. The next 
        robot that came into existence were called Webcrawler during the year 1944 and the one 
        people might know went be Googlebot which was created in 1996. Programs such as the 
        Sub7 where created for them to connect to any IRC channel (the interexchange of messages 
        through the web) for alarming messages. Basically such programs were designed or created 
        to spy or listen on people’s interactions. Multiple internet bots were created and eventually 
        moved the OG IRC to HTTP and many others.</p> 
        <br>

        <p> A web bot is “a software application that performs automated tasks by running scripts over 
        the internet” (Knecht, 2016). Abusix gives a good summary of the development of multiple 
        web bots. There have been a development of good internet bots and also a development of 
        bad internet bots. I don’t think the existence or constant of web bots is harmful to the 
        masses, it is the way we use the web bots that are harmful. Cybercriminals made the biggest 
        malware during the year 2007 which was called “Storm”. This web bot infected millions of 
        people’s computers and resulting in crimes such as fraud. History just shows us even if 
        internet bots’ initial intention was to help human being’s access to information easier, 
        someone out there will take advantage of this privilege. </p>
        <br>

        <p>In conclusion, web bots are there to help human beings and not replace them. Cybercriminals 
        and hackers have used web bots in order to do harm to the masses but with every villain
        comes a hero. Attacks such the Storm were able to controlled by good coders and 
        programmers and the development of web bots was not stopped because of history such as 
        that one. The time in which web bots were developed, which as in 1994, only indicates to me 
        that even better web bots are coming in the near future</p>
