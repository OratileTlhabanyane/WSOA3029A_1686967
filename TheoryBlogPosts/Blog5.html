    <h1> Close reading and reflection on Knaflic's 'Dissecting model visuals - Chapter 6'</h1> 
    <time datetime="2021/09/14">Posted Tuesday, 14 September 2021</time>
    <p> Author: Oratile Tlhabanyane</p>
    <br>
        <p>Cole Knaflic continues to dive deep into his topic of storytelling with data by dissecting into multiple models of visual representations, different types of graphs. 
            Knaflic states that there are basic aspects to look at when considering if a model of visual representation is good or not. These namely being: choice of ordering of data, alignment, positioning of elements, and use of words (Knaflic n.d.). This chapter looks at 5 models of data visualization. I am only going to be looking at two models using a few of Knaflic’s aspects of good models of visuals. 
            </p> 
        <br>

        <p>The first model, see figure 1.1, is a classic line graph and is represented quite well. Just looking at the graph without reading Knaflic’s description of the graph, the data is communicated quite clearly as the user or reader could see what the line graph is assessing based on the title of the graph. However, the first thing I got “drawn” to was the bold line that is titled ‘Progress to date’ with a bold amount in dollars. I guess the number one important information they wanted the reader to know is the progress of the money is raised since the launch of the campaign to today.  </p> 
        <br>

        <p> After reading Knaflic’s description of this model it seems like he also sees this graph as a good graph because of reasons such as good use of words, the use of thickness in fonts to emphasis information and thin lines to de-emphasise information (Knaflic n.d.). However, Knaflic concludes the analysis of this model, after analysing more aspects, by saying that there isn’t a “single right answer” to the ‘perfect’ way of representing data but the designer of the graph should always look at their context, the data and how you would want the receivers of this information to absorb the information and further utilize this information (Knaflic n.d.).

        <p>The last model, see figure 1.2, I am going to look at is a stacked bar graph which is titled 100% stacked bars on Knaflic’s reading.  The first glance at this bar graph, one could see the red information written on the far right and in ‘Miss’, and in also the bars, especially when they added the actual percentages in the bars’ red spaces. The use of red draws me to the goals that were missed in each year, in each quarter of the year which emphasizes its important. The next important information is the goals of projects that were exceeded, and the last important data is the goals that were met. The reason I ranked this graph like that is because of the way in which my eyes got drawn to the most ‘attention drawer’ to the least. Knaflic discusses how the reader’s attention is drawn by using colour in which in this instance red is used to draw attention to certain data. There are multiple of other aspects that Knaflic discusses on this graph and the rest of the other three in this chapter but those could be discussed another time (Knaflic n.d.).</p>

    </p>
    <P> Knaflic in his closing emphasizes how this reading looked at how important choice of graph type and ordering of data are (Knaflic n.d.). In this reflection I mainly looked at what our eyes got drawn to when looking at the two graphs. However, there are multiple aspects he discussed, good and bad but the one question he wants you to ask yourself when analysing a graph, is when you see something you like, ask yourself why (Knaflic n.d.).</P>
