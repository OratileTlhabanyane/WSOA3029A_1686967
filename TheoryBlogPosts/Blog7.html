    <h1>Graphs Critical reflection on the representation and communication strategies used in your two graphs</h1>

            In this blog I am going to be critically reflecting on my two graphs that I did for my data visualization. I am going to seeing the two graphs’ representation and communication strategies I used in the development of the graphs and I will be using Knaflic’s reading to analyse the graphs. I developed a bar chart and a pie chart for my data visualization section. I will first look at the bar graph first then move onto the pie chart. 
        </p> 
            <br>
        <p>
            Firstly, I did not have any specific reason why I chose the graph I used to show my data. I needed graphs and I just chose those two types of graphs. The first one was a bar chart and the data used is comparing the value of bitcoin between years 2021 and 2020. The y-axis shows values from 100 000 to 1 000 000 and the x-axis shows the labels of each graph. This graph is very simple and there is no use of colour to communicate information. However, the title of the graph does communicate what data is being assessed and compared which I sufficient. The bar chart could be improved by adding labelling on the y-axis with, for example “Value in currency ZAR” in bold text. I could also improve this graph by using red for the highest bar and a lighter red for the lowest bar. The reason why I want to make better use of colour is because Knaflic discusses how user’s attention gets drawn by the good use of colour to represent data (Knaflic, no date). I could also add the exact ZAR value of a bitcoin for each year on top of its bar. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The next one I used is a pie chart. This chart, I had to use two different colours to differentiate the two values. The pie chart has the title of the data being analysed which is good way to communicate to the user what they are looking at. The chart has labels for the two years looking at the value of bitcoin. I would like to improve the way I label the segments, maybe make the fond a bit smaller to make them fit in the middle of their individual segments. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Overall, my graphs show the bare minimum communication and representation skills and there is a lot of opportunity to improve each graph use the readings we looked at each semester.
