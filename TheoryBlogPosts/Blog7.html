    <h1>Usability and accessibility on the web </h1>

            There is a difference between the term "usability" and "accessibility". Usability is defined by Interaction Design Foundation as 
            “a measure of how well a specific user in a specific context can use a product/design to achieve a defined goal effectively,
             efficiently and satisfactorily.” (“What is Usability?” n.d.). The key word here is ‘use’. Accessibility is “the quality or 
             characteristic of something that makes it possible to approach, enter, or use it” (“Accessibility” n.d.). 
             Thus, there is a difference between the two. 
            </p> 
            <br>
        <p>
            So, what is ‘usability on the web’, usability geek defines website usability as a phrase that has evolved into focusing in the 
            various facets of interaction. (“The Difference Between Web Site Usability And Accessibility” 2011). In my understanding, 
            usability on the web is the ability to use website. A websites usability can be measured using three aspects which are effectiveness, 
            efficiency, and satisfaction, these three aspects can be measured at the state in which how well can a user achieve their goals on the website.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        To further tackle this term, I am going to use examples. I, as a user of the internet and its websites. 
        I always look for websites that make my experience convenient. Thus, accessing a website that makes me to reach my goals difficult, 
        it just means it not a website that can be easily used. A website that uses, for example, conventional layout design in makes 
        usability easier and more efficient for the user. However, if web designers were to use layout design that is complex and not conventional, 
        this decreases user satisfaction and effectiveness as the user will be more concerned in trying to figure how the navigation of the website works instead of trying to achieve their goals.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Moreover, what is ‘accessibility on the web’? Usability Geek defines it as the ability for “people with disabilities can perceive, understand, 
            navigate, and interact with the web, and they can contribute to the web”(“The Difference Between Web Site Usability And Accessibility” 2011). 
            People with disability including people who are visually impaired, deaf and/or neurological disabilities. 
            I think website accessibility is quite straightforward with its definition, essentially it is making sure that website can be accessed by anyone, 
            not exclude any being with any sort of disabilities. This is why it is encouraged for web developers to use semantic mark ups when they code their websites.
             Semantic mark up is “understanding the hierarchy of your content and how both users and machines will read it”(“Semantic HTML for Meaningful Webpages” 2017).
