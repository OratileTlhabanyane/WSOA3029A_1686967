    <h1> Critical Reflection on the design of your website, it's UI and it's UX </h1>
        <p>

                To start off my reflection of the design of my website I will be going through the current wireframes I designed. 
The website layout is quite simple and user-friendly for all my pages. In last semester’s resources, it states how User Experience is measured by how well the usability of the website is. My website’s theme is minimalism, the simpler, the better but I had to keep a good balance in the information that I add so that the pages don’t seem too empty. For example, for my homepage, see figure 1.1, I used a lot of images to fill up empty spaces, however, I made sure that the images did communicate relevant information to the user about the website. I used subheadings and descriptions under the images to communicate to the user information on the website. I used the Serial Position Effect for my website design (Yablonski n.d.). This is one of laws of UX which talks about how users remember information in the beginning and end of a page layout, so I placed my important information in beginning and end of the page layouts and that information introduce my API and how my website is going to carry out the story of the API through data visualization.

                The structure of my website is quite conventional because, like I mentioned above, I want to keep my page as simple as it can be for better User Experience. Simpler layouts of websites do not necessarily mean it will equal better user experience. However, my initial design goal for my website was to make it simple in hopes of better user experience. Plus, a simpler Information Architecture makes web developing easier for me. Information Architecture is the way in which content is organized and the overall construction of the website (“Information Architecture Basics” 2013). My interface is readable and legible. These two are the basic principle of design (“Typographic Readability and Legibility” n.d.). The way I organized my images and data visualization I tried to make sure I used the right font in regards to size and choice of font design. The placement of the visual representations should not overpower the text and vice-versa, it must be easy to identify which heading and description if for what visual representation and that information readable.

                One thing I struggle with is wanting to improve my User Interface and User Experience without making the website too complicated to navigate, however my wireframes will improve as time goes. My data visualization would even get to a state where it is animated as Kidd’s reading states that websites are presenting data/information that is interactable and animated (Kidd, 2015). Thus there is a lot of improvement that needs to go into my website design which I am excited for.
