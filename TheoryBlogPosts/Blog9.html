    <h1> Information is Beautiful – Interactivity as a semiotic device </h1>

            The case study I chose for this week’s blog is ‘Hierarchy of Digital Distractions’ on the website Information is Beautiful. We must analyse the case study in terms of the role of interactivity as a semiotic device. I am first going to breaking the phrase “role of interactivity as a semiotic device”. According to my research, the role of interactivity is “the ability to address a person and to gather and remember the response of that person” (Liu and Shrum, 2002). Moreover, a semioticist is “the study of signs and sign processes, indication, designation, likeness, analogy, allegory, metonymy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication “.
        </p> 
            <br>
        <p>
            This case study shows us a hierarchy of different types of digital distractions from the least distracting to the most distracting digital platform/device. The graph is categorised from automatic straight up to digital night. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The first question I would ask myself is if this hierarchy is interactive and if it is, what is the role of this interactivity as a semiotic device. When analysing this graph, it does not seem to be interactive. It looks like a picture that was implemented in the website’s page’s HTML and it wasn’t even built using SVG elements or d3.js library. It doesn’t gather and remember the response of a user because it doesn’t even allow the user to communicate with it. So, if there is no interactivity, I do not think it can act as a semiotic device. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            However, if the hierarchy gave the user an opportunity to interact with it then we could see it play a role as semiotic device. For example, look at figure 1.1, if the user were to hover over the section of automatic and the text showed actual statistics of the number of people in 2021 get distracted by LinkedIn updates, then this would be one of the great indications, through sign, the information of the level of digital distractions.
