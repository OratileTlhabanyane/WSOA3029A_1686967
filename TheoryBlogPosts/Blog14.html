    <h1>Data-driven storytelling</h1>

            Ethics in data-driven visual storytelling is the chapter 10 of Richie et al’s reading. This chapter looks at the different ethics that visual-data storyteller need to focus on when acquiring data and implementing it. This chapter looks at ethics such as Provenance and Quantification of data acquisition, Normalization, Aggregation, Algorithmic Derivation, and Filtering during the transformation of data and many more. However, I want to look at look at only two ethics which are Filtering and Anonymization which fall under Data Transformation in this chapter.
        </p> 
            <br>
        <p>
            The first ethic I want to look into within data-driven storytelling is Filtering. Visual-data storytellers receive data as raw as one can get so it is important for them to filter what needs to be filtered in order to remove irrelevant information and keep important or relevant data/information. This is “an essential operation that enables successful data-driven storytelling” (Riche et al., 2018). Ethical consideration is needed when handpicking data that is relevant to the opinion and supports it. I agree with this statement because in order to pick the ‘right’ data to remain, you have to be able to differentiate from what is ‘relevant’ information and what isn’t. This could only be known if you know what you are trying to prove, this being the “opinion”. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The second ethic is Anonymization. If one has experienced taking part in a survey, the people requesting for the data always try to keep the participant as anonymous as possible because most of the time they just need the relevant data and having their names and address isn’t sometimes necessary. Surveys about political views, criminal history, etc should not, ethically, include the participant’s names, contacts, addresses, or any personal information because it may be dangerous if there’s any opposing personal viewers. Thus, this is such an important ethical step during the data transformation because it protects participants that take part in certain surveyors and the visual-data storyteller still gets the required data.
