    <h1>Critical reflection on the representation and communication strategies using interactivity in your own Interactive Data Visualization</h1>

            Interactivity has to be able to “address a person and to gather and remember the response of that person”(Liu and Shrum, 2002). To put it in my words, the user needs to be able interact with the platform and be able to get a response or answer to their interaction. This week I must reflect on my interactive data visualisation, in other words, I have to reflect on my interactive graph. Can the user interact with my graph, and do they get an answer for what they requested for when interacting? Does the graph represent the data and communicate clearly? These questions will be answered and reflected on this blog.

            I used a scatter plot to show my interactivity. The scatter plot is showing the data for the value of bitcoin from 2016 up to 2021. I REAALLLYY struggle to get this interactivity going the way in which I wanted. I was able to get the interactivity that I wanted but not as seemingly as I wanted. The reason why I say this is because when the user arrives on the page, all the pop-up messages which are only supposed to show when the user clicks on a spot, these are already showing. However, when the user does eventually press on a circle, a fact about that year’s bitcoin pops up and when they press a different circle, the old pop up disappears, and the requested fact pop up. This interaction communicates quite well with the user because they get a response for the information they requested.

            I could have added labels on the y-axis and x-axis just to represent the data a bit better. However, the title of the scatter plot does communicate to the user what data they going to be looking at. I want to improve on the responsive design for this graph for my final exam. This doesn’t only go for this graph but the two other graphs I created. The responsive design will make the user experience better because they won’t be forced to view my data using a PC in order to see what is being communicated and represented.
