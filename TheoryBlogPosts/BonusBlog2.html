        <p>
            I am a very antisocial person in general so talking to people is definitely hard to do, 
            especially getting to know knew peopl. I find it hard to express myself so the best way I know how to express myself
            is through my poetry and photography. I love how art becomes a tool of expression for me, just like how some people
            find it easier to express themselves by tweeting or writing a status on Facebook. In this day age of technology
            people are provided with different ways that they can express themselves. However, some people tend to cross the line 
            when they are "expressing" themselves and end up offending other people. Nowadays people are getting lawsuits for simply tweeting 
            something false about another person or even liking and retweeting a false tweetn about someone. This just amkes interacting with 
            people online even more scary. WHat if I am merely just expressing my thoughts on something/someone, the possibilities of me catching a lawsuit
            are higher now in 2021 then there were back in 2009. People are now "woke" and will take offence to almost everything.
