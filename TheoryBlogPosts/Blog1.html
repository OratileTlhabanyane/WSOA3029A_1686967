        <h1 >Li Overview of Data Visualization</h1>
        <time datetime="2021/08/17">Posted Tuesday, 17 August 2021</time>
        <p> Author: Oratile Tlhabanyane</p>
        <br>

        <p>
            Li starts off the reading by giving a brief introduction to the history of the term “data visualization”. 
            Data visualization has multiple definitions, but the common definitions usually include the connection of data being transformed visually. 
            Li states different authors who define data visualisation but there is one definition I can effortlessly comprehend. 
            This definition is by Manovich in Li, “a transformation of quantified data which is not visual into a visual representation” (Li, 2020). 
        </p>
    <br>
        
        <p>There are four main points that are involved in data visualization, which are real-time interaction, on-the-fly processing, 
            visual scalability and user assistance and personalization. However, it can be categorised in two sub-headings which are information 
            visualization and scientific visualization. To briefly describe these two sub-headings as the term themselves are quite self-explanatory, 
            information visualization is used represent abstract data visually and scientific visualization used to represent scientific data. 
            In the process of data visualization is the transition of data into information. 
        </p>
    <br>
        <p>The difference between data and information is data is “raw, unprocessed information that is not recognized as having any meaning” 
            (Li, 2020), for example people’s names, age, height, etc. however, information is described as the collections of data which provides 
            answers the questions in which raw doesn’t, for example information will tell us why we have a person’s name, age and height and states 
            the purpose of this data. </p> 
        
        <p>Li continues the overview of data visualization by looking at the different forms of traditional visualization. The two sub-headings to 
            data visualization are quite different but similar at the same time. The forms that we use to represent information visualisations are 
            tables, charts, trees, maps, scatter-plots, diagrams and graphs. I recognized most of these traditional forms, however, scatter-plot is 
            one form of traditional visualization I am not quite familiar with. The reading states that scatter plots are described to be quite 
            useful when using multivariate data presented with x or y coordinates.  This form of traditional data visualization is also quite useful 
            in scientific publication. Moreover, scientific visualization is represented through simulations, waveforms and volume. </p>
    <br>
        <p> The reading described thoroughly the different forms of traditional and gave some visual examples of the forms. Because there are so 
            many forms of traditional of data visualization, the need to be represented well. Thus, there are characteristics used to identify good 
            data visualization which are readability, recognizability of previous knowledge and/or encounters and lastly meaning of picture or visual 
            form. Li goes onto to discuss human perception with data visualization and the perception process. Ware in Li says that human perception 
            measures the quality and quantity of information presented. 
            Data visualization is simple turning data or information into visual form but these visual forms need to carry meaning.
