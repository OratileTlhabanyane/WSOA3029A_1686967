    <h1>Data-driven Art</h1> 
    <time datetime="2021/11/08">Posted Tuesday, 8 November 2021</time>

        <p>
            Data-driven art in my understanding is artwork that is mainly done based on data, numbers, or statistics, essentially facts. So essentially, artwork that is based on statical facts and not art that is based on emotion and imagination. This blog is going to be analysing a data driven artwork ‘in terms of the artistic strategies used and meaning created’. The artwork I chose to look at is called “Museum Week” by Marcin Ignac, Henryk Wollik and BRIGHT (Museum Week, no date). The data that is driving this artwork is the Twitter activity that took part during Museum Week in the year 2015 of all the 2207 different museums that took part. The team that created this artwork took the data from each museum’s Twitter profile.
        </p> 
            <br>
        <p>
            The concept behind this project were to turn the individual museums into actual artworks themselves because it is usually the reversed role, where the museums display the artworks. The team artistic strategy to implement this concept was to construct the artwork from two parts. The first part shows quite a number of artistic strategies used to create the artwork which are, for example, the number of years the museum spent on Twitter determines the shape of the DNA-like structure if the artwork and within this artwork the team illustrates every tweet made by the museum with as a “spherical shape inside its structure” (Museum Week, no date). The team also shows another artistic strategy of them using each museums Twitter profile theme colour or/and the colours of the museum’s logo as their colour pallet for the creation of the artwork to give them more of a unique identity look at figure 1.1 for example.

        <p>
            The second part/element of the artwork is the ‘flow’ which is also tweet data driven. The other artistic strategy they added is how with every tweet made by the museum, a stroke is added to the artwork, the meaning behind this is to show how the stroke represent the number of people visiting the space (Museum Week, no date). 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This is my first time seeing or even hearing about artworks that are driven by data, this is quite concept and is really working towards the world of digital art.
