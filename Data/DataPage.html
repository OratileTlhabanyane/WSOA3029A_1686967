    The data visualisation I chose to explore in my website is quite out of my box. I initially wanted to do my analysis and visual representation to around the story of a black woman in South Africa. I wanted my website to communicate the risks of being a woman in South Africa. 	The layout of whole website and colour scheme is very calm and relaxing because the stats and data that I was going to represent is very unsettling. The API or data I initially wanted to look at was how the mental health of South Africa men and financial background affects GBV in the country, specifically violence around women. However, I wanted to explore more of the GBV around different races as well.  Give more more representation and communication by including certain videos and articles that discuss the causes of women abuse in South Africa. I was going to use  South African maps and show stats of the percentage of GBV in each provinces,  and categorize them by their causes ‘mental health’, ‘financial circumstances’, etc. However, I couldn’t find an API that could help me communicate this story. So I resolved to an API that is really out of my comfort zone.

    Cryptocurrency is a new market of trading digital coins. Similar to how FOREX pairs currencies with different countries to see the value of one of the pairs. Cryptocurrency puts the value of 1 coin in comparison to a country’s currency. This is a new way of making money but with less risk than FOREX. I wanted to change my narrative and have my website talk about how an artist steps into the world of finance and trading. The reason why I wanted to step into this specific area is because ethe way in which artworks are starting to be valued, this value system is called NFTs. Read more on NFTS on <a  style="color: black;"href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56371912"> https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56371912</a>.

    On this page, I am using a bar graph to visualize the ZAR data against Bitcoin. Thus, how much 1 bitcoin costs in South Africa. I looked at how the value of Bitcoin grew or declined in South Africa between the years of 2018 to date. The reason why I chose this data range is because I wanted to see if the Cryptocurrency market in South Africa is something worth investing. If people in my country invest more in the idea of buying a digital coin then they will be willing to invest in NFTs and help artists earn more money when it comes to their art.
